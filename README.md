# Leaf
In this multiplayer game, you must place leaves to direct the steady stream of ants into your goal!

Ants begin spawning from a random tile on the board. Each player can place a tile on any square to cause the ants to change direction. The object of the game is to direct the ants into your goal on the side of the board.

Ants always turn left whenever they hit an obstactle. Not right. Not backwards. Left. When they get to a goal they are removed from the playing field.

The player who directs the most number of ants into their goal by the end of the game wins.
